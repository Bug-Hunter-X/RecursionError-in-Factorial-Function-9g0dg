# RecursionError in Python Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with recursive functions in Python: the RecursionError. The error arises when a recursive function fails to define an appropriate base case, leading to infinite recursion.

The `bug.py` file shows the faulty factorial function. The `bugSolution.py` demonstrates how to fix the issue.
